Earlier this year we announced a feature that we called [wallet-less airdrops](/blog/email-recipient). We realized that too many web3 experiences required users to first go through the complicated steps before they could start enjoying the fun experiences. So we introduced wallet-less airdrops which basically lets users receive an NFT _before_ they actually configure a wallet.

A few weeks ago, we announced our [web3 event hosting application](/blog/events-launch)! It was used by a dozen events at [ETHDenver](/blog/ethdenver2023), from DIDDay, to a very cool ShakeShack activation!

One of the feedback that we got from several organizers was that they wanted to also make it trivial for non-crypto users to quickly RSVP for their events, provided that these events were indeed free. So today, we're introducing wallet-less RSVP!

You can try it by registering for this virtual launch party!

We also added the ability to set the end time for events, and added a calendar invite in the confirmation emails! [Get started now](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/event): organize your web3 meetup, crypto party using Unlock!
