## Unlock Web

A javascript package for front-end integration of the Unlock Protocol in popular frameworks and more!

Supported: React

## Usage

Please check the `examples` folder for examples of integrations.
All the examples use this lock deployed on the Goerli network. You can cancel a membership from the [Unlock keychain](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/keychain) UI if you need to test flows with an expired membership.

## A note on decentralization

This package uses some of the convenience layer tools built by Unlock Labs, including the checkout flow and our RPC endpoints. These are meant as ways to ease development and deployment work but could (and should) be replaced with your own implementations!
